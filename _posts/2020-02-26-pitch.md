## "I have spent hours but all I get is "invalid_client" error,  I don't even know what am I doing wrong!"

You have followed a tutorial on how to implement Sign in with Apple step by step, but you are stuck at the dreaded "invalid_client" error every time you try to validate the authorization code with **/auth/token**. 

You checked your client_id, client_secret and even the redirect_uri parameters, all of them seem correct, then you try to swap client_id with the app bundle ID, web services ID, changing the headers used to generate the client secret JWT... hours has passed and despite all the trial and error, you are still getting the same "invalid_client" error! ðŸ¤¬

The error message "invalid_client" isn't particular helpful as it doesn't say which part of your code is wrong, could it be your client_id? client_secret? or could it be the authorization code that you've gotten from the app isn't formatted properly? You wished Apple would provide a more helpful error message on solving the issue.

Apple require us to implement Sign in with Apple before April 2020, yet the documentation is severely lacking, the obscure error message certainly doesn't help. You starts to worry what if you couldn't implement Sign in with Apple before the deadline, and Apple rejected your app upcoming update, causing the delay of some fixes/updates to your app, which makes your users and your boss unhappy ðŸ˜£.

## "I have scoured all the documentation at length and have still not gotten anywhere."

After spending countless hours battling the token validating issue, you have finally managed to retrieve the token! yay! But now you are stuck again, as
there isn't even a word in Apple documentation on how to handle subsequent REST API call after user has signed in successfully! As the token returned from validating authorization code is just valid for 10 minutes, and Apple only allow [refreshing token once a day](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/verifying_a_user) (more than that will result in throttling), how should we handle subsequent REST API call to the backend using token? 

There's an endpoint to get Apple public key, but how do I even use this hash to verify signature?! This certainly doesn't look like a public key file format (eg: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----  xxxxxx -----END PUBLIC KEY----- )

Enough complain about Apple, let's pause a moment and imagine..

## What if you could implement Sign in with Apple with ease, and continue to push app updates confidently?

Wouldn't it be nice if there's a **straightforward, step-by-step guide which you can follow** to implement Sign in with Apple? From generating public key, validate authorization code, parsing identityToken to handling sign out?

You could implement Sign in with Apple **within a day**, and continue working on features or bug fixes that matters, which make your users happier (and also your boss).

## Learn the workings of JWT (JSON Web Token) and JWK (JSON Web Key)
Most of the frustration arise when implementing Sign in with Apple is because we haven't deal with JSON Web Token before, and generating a JSON Web Token (JWT) for the **client_secret** can be a confusing step especially Apple is using a quirky algorithm named "RS256" elliptic curve.

IdentityToken retrieved from Apple's API is also in JWT format, which contains an unique identifier for the user in the **sub** key : 
{% highlight json %}
{
  iss: "https://appleid.apple.com",
  aud: "es.fluffy.AppleLogin",
  exp: 1578850937,
  iat: 1578850337,
  sub: "001802.ba20d2adb5954ff0ace4972268a21303.1014",
  c_hash: "JXNEyqNeiUwJ5_tNjYZkLg",
  email: "uikyccaycc@privaterelay.appleid.com",
  email_verified: "true",
  is_private_email: "true",
  auth_time: 1578850337
}
{% endhighlight %}

"001802.ba20d2adb5954ff0ace4972268a21303.1014" is the unique user ID (which correspond to an Apple ID) for your app.
