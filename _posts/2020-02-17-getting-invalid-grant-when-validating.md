## Pain

- I'm trying to implement Sign in with Apple and it's been going fine **until I tried to validate the authorization code using the Web Service Endpoint** â€“ https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token.

- The error I'm getting back from the request is invalid_grant.

- If I decode the client_secret jwt that I created, it looks like this, **which is what the documentation says it should look like**. (I followed the documentation and still getting errors)

- Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
